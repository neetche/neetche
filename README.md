<!---
Rows and rows of crosses
Standing in the sand
Statues of the phallen
Watching over the land
Tomb of the Phallic Warrior
Lays tilted in decay
Another year passes
On remembrance day
There's a hole in the sky
I've got blood running in my eye
I'm exposed to forged attrition
A battle cry for remission
The smoke filled air burns my hair
Filled with toxic nerve despair
There no way to get back
Another order to attack

Kampfbereit in der Zeit (ready for combat in time)
Kameraden dürfen wir nicht vergessen (we must not forget our comrades)
Die Blumen liegen auf seinem Körper (the flowers are laying on his body)

Rows and rows of crosses
Standing in the sand
Statues of the phallen
Watching over the land
Tomb of the Phallic Warrior
Lay tilted in decay
Another year passes
On remembrance day
The unforgiven run at night
Aiming with their rifle sights
They give their all when they're called
To save the masses, to take the fall
It's sad, but true, it never ends
The constant conflict. without amends
The final struggle from within
Will end up without misery
Kampfbereit in der Zeit (ready for combat in time)
Kameraden dürfen wir nicht vergessen (we must not forget our comrades)
Die Blumen liegen auf seinem Körper (the flowers are laying on his body)
Das Requiem für den Letzten (A requiem for the last one)
The good, the bad, it's all sad
Nothing left but a body bag
There's a hole in the sky
I've got blood running in my eye
